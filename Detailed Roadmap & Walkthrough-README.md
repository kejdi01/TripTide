RouteMuse - Detailed Roadmap & Walkthrough
This document outlines a detailed 12-week plan for developing the MVP of RouteMuse.
Overall Goal
Develop a functional MVP of RouteMuse that allows users to input a start/destination, see the route on a map, view time-adjusted weather forecasts along the route, and get basic AI-curated POI suggestions.
Methodology
Agile-ish, focusing on weekly sprints. Each week has primary goals and more granular sub-tasks.

Phase 1: Foundations & Core Mapping (Weeks 1-4)
Month 1 Goal: User can input start/destination, see a route plotted on a map, and view weather forecasts for segments of that route at estimated arrival times.
Week 1: Project Setup & Basic Backend/Frontend Communication

Goal: Establish project structures and ensure frontend can talk to backend.
Sub-steps:
Environment Setup:
Install Python, Node.js, pip, npm/yarn.
Set up virtual environment for Python (e.g., venv).
Initialize Git repository.


Backend (Flask):
Install Flask, Flask-CORS (for development).
Create basic Flask app structure (app.py, requirements.txt).
Implement a simple "hello world" API endpoint (e.g., /api/ping).


Frontend (React + Vite):
Create React project using Vite (npm create vite@latest my-routemuse-app -- --template react-ts or js).
Install Axios (or use fetch) for API calls, Tailwind CSS.
Configure Tailwind CSS.
Create a basic App layout component.
Implement a button/useEffect to call the backend's /api/ping and display the response.


Documentation: Initial README.md with project setup.



Week 2: Mapping API Integration - Displaying a Static Route

Goal: Fetch and display a route on a map using a mapping API.
Sub-steps:
API Key Acquisition: Sign up for Mapbox (recommended) or Google Maps Platform and get an API key.
Backend:
Install requests library.
Create a new Flask endpoint (e.g., /api/route).
This endpoint initially takes hardcoded start/destination coordinates.
Implement logic to call the chosen Mapping API's Directions endpoint.
Parse the response to extract the route geometry (polyline).
Return the route geometry to the frontend.


Frontend:
Install a mapping library (e.g., react-map-gl for Mapbox, or google-maps-react).
Set up basic map component.
Fetch route geometry from the backend /api/route endpoint.
Render the polyline on the map.





Week 3: Dynamic Route Input & Weather API Basics

Goal: Allow users to input start/destination and fetch weather data for a single point.
Sub-steps:
Frontend:
Create input fields for "Start Address" and "Destination Address".
On submit, send these addresses to the backend.


Backend (Geocoding & Route):
Modify /api/route endpoint to accept addresses.
Integrate Mapping API's Geocoding service to convert addresses to coordinates.
Use these coordinates to call the Directions API.
Return route geometry and total estimated duration.


API Key Acquisition: Sign up for OpenWeatherMap (or similar) and get an API key.
Backend (Weather Test):
Create a new test endpoint (e.g., /api/weather_test) that takes lat/lon.
Implement logic to call OpenWeatherMap API for current weather at that lat/lon.
Return basic weather info (temp, description).


Frontend (Weather Test): Call /api/weather_test for route's midpoint (calculated from geometry) and display.



Week 4: Route Segmentation & Time-Adjusted Weather Display

Goal: Display weather forecasts along the route at estimated times of arrival.
Sub-steps:
Backend (Route Segmentation Logic):
In the /api/route response processing:
Get the list of steps/legs from the Directions API response.
Iterate through the steps to identify ~5-7 strategic points along the route (e.g., start of each major leg, or points at ~20% intervals of total duration).
For each point, calculate its coordinates and the ETA (cumulative duration from start).




Backend (Weather Service):
Create a service/function get_weather_for_eta(lat, lon, eta_timestamp).
This function calls OpenWeatherMap's hourly forecast, selecting the forecast slice closest to eta_timestamp.
The /api/route endpoint now calls this service for each segmented point.
Bundle route geometry, segment points (with coords, ETA, weather data) into the API response.


Frontend:
Parse the enhanced /api/route response.
For each segment point with weather data, display a weather icon and temperature on the map at its coordinates.
Implement loading states while data is fetched.






Phase 2: POI Integration & Basic AI (Weeks 5-8)
Month 2 Goal: Integrate Points of Interest (POIs) along the route and apply initial AI (sentiment analysis) to POI data.
Week 5: Basic POI Fetching (Mapping API)

Goal: Fetch and display generic POIs near the route.
Sub-steps:
Backend (POI Service):
Decide on POI categories for MVP (e.g., "cafe", "restaurant", "gas_station").
For a few selected points along the route (e.g., midpoint, 75% point), use the Mapping API's "Places" or "Nearby Search" functionality.
Query for POIs within a certain radius (e.g., 1-2 km) of these points, filtered by MVP categories.
Add fetched POI data (name, location, category) to the /api/route response.


Frontend:
Display fetched POIs as distinct markers on the map.
Allow clicking a POI marker to show a basic popup with its name and category.





Week 6: Hugging Face Setup & First AI Model (Sentiment for POIs)

Goal: Analyze sentiment of POI reviews/descriptions.
Sub-steps:
Backend (Hugging Face Setup):
Install transformers library and torch (or tensorflow).
Choose a sentiment analysis model (e.g., nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment). Download/cache it on first run.
Create an AI service module (e.g., ai_services.py).
Implement a function analyze_sentiment(text) that uses the loaded pipeline.


Backend (POI Sentiment Processing):
Data Source for Sentiment:
If your POI API provides reviews: use them.
If not: For MVP, you might use POI descriptions, or even manually add 2-3 sample review texts to your POI data structure for demonstration. Be transparent about this in your showcase.


Modify the POI fetching logic: For each fetched POI, if review/description text is available, pass it to analyze_sentiment.
Store the sentiment score/label with the POI data.


Frontend:
Visually indicate POIs with positive sentiment (e.g., a small star icon next to the marker, or color-code the marker).
Update POI popup to show the (demo) sentiment.





Week 7: Asynchronous Task Processing (Celery Introduction)

Goal: Offload time-consuming API calls (weather, POI, AI) to background tasks.
Sub-steps:
Backend (Celery Setup):
Install Celery and a message broker (Redis is easy for local dev, RabbitMQ for more robust).
Configure Celery with your Flask app.
Define Celery tasks for:
Fetching weather for a single point & ETA.
Fetching POIs for a given location.
Analyzing sentiment for a POI.




Backend (Refactor API Calls):
When /api/route is called:
Initial response: Route geometry and segment points (without weather/POI yet).
Launch Celery tasks to fetch weather for each segment and POIs for relevant locations.
Launch Celery tasks to analyze sentiment for fetched POIs.




Frontend & Backend (Polling/WebSockets for Updates - Choose one for MVP):
Polling (Simpler for MVP): Frontend periodically polls a new endpoint (e.g., /api/route_status/<task_id> or /api/route_data_update/<route_id>) to get updated weather/POI data as tasks complete.
WebSockets (Better UX, more complex): Implement WebSockets (e.g., Flask-SocketIO) for real-time updates from backend to frontend as data becomes available. For a solo 2-3 month project, polling is likely more feasible.


Frontend: Update map with new data as it arrives. Show "loading weather/POIs..." indicators.



Week 8: AI for POI Tagging (Keyword/Zero-Shot - Basic)

Goal: Use AI to add descriptive tags to POIs.
Sub-steps:
Backend (AI Service Expansion):
Choose a model: KeyBERT for keyword extraction or facebook/bart-large-mnli for zero-shot classification.
Implement a function get_poi_tags(description_or_reviews, candidate_labels_for_zero_shot).
Candidate labels for zero-shot (e.g., "good coffee", "scenic view", "quick stop", "family friendly").


Backend (Celery Task):
Create a new Celery task to apply this tagging to POIs that have descriptions/reviews.
Store these tags with the POI data.


Frontend:
Display 1-2 top tags in the POI popup.
(Optional) Allow filtering POIs by these AI-generated tags.






Phase 3: Refinement, User Experience & Deployment (Weeks 9-12)
Month 3 Goal: Polish the application, focus on usability, and deploy a shareable version.
Week 9: AI-Powered Suggestion Logic & UI for Suggestions

Goal: Implement basic logic to "suggest" a few POIs.
Sub-steps:
Backend (Suggestion Logic):
Define criteria for a "good suggestion" for MVP (e.g., POI is a cafe, has >4-star sentiment, has "good coffee" tag, and is roughly at the route's halfway point).
In the data processing chain (after all POI data is fetched and analyzed), identify 1-3 POIs that meet these criteria.
Add a "suggested_pois" list to the API response.


Frontend:
Highlight suggested POIs distinctively on the map (e.g., special icon, animation).
Create a small "Route Suggestions" panel listing these POIs with a brief reason ("Great coffee stop around halfway!").





Week 10: UI/UX Polish & Error Handling

Goal: Improve the overall look, feel, and robustness.
Sub-steps:
Frontend (UI):
Refine map interactions (zoom behavior, popups).
Ensure consistent styling with Tailwind CSS.
Improve layout for different screen sizes (basic responsiveness).
Add clear visual feedback for user actions (button clicks, loading states).


Frontend & Backend (Error Handling):
Frontend: Display user-friendly error messages for API failures (e.g., "Could not find route," "Weather data unavailable").
Backend: Implement more robust error catching in API handlers and Celery tasks. Log errors.
Handle edge cases: No route found, API keys invalid, external APIs down.





Week 11: Testing & Final Touches

Goal: Ensure application stability and prepare for deployment.
Sub-steps:
Testing:
Manual E2E: Test various routes (short, long, city, rural). Test different browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
Backend Unit Tests (Basic): Write some unit tests for critical Flask services/logic (e.g., ETA calculation, sentiment service wrapper). (pytest)
Frontend Component Tests (Optional for MVP): Basic tests for key React components if time permits. (React Testing Library)


Code Cleanup: Remove unused code, add comments, ensure consistent formatting.
Performance: Check for obvious frontend/backend performance bottlenecks (e.g., too many re-renders, slow DB queries - though DB is simple for MVP).



Week 12: Deployment & Documentation

Goal: Make the project live and document it for showcase.
Sub-steps:
Deployment Preparation:
Choose hosting: Vercel for frontend, Heroku/Render/Railway for Flask backend & Redis.
Configure environment variables for production (API keys, database URL, FLASK_ENV=production).
Ensure requirements.txt and package.json are up-to-date.
For Flask on Heroku/Render: Procfile and gunicorn setup.


Deployment:
Deploy frontend to Vercel.
Deploy backend (and Redis if needed) to Heroku/Render.
Test the live application thoroughly.


Documentation (GitHub README):
Update README.md with:
Clear project description and value proposition.
Live demo link.
Screenshots/GIFs of the app in action.
Detailed Tech Stack.
Instructions for local setup (for others to run it).
Explanation of AI features and API integrations.
Known limitations and future ideas.




Portfolio Preparation: Prepare talking points for showcasing the project.




This roadmap is ambitious. If certain AI features or Celery integration prove too time-consuming, they can be simplified or postponed for a post-MVP iteration. The core is a working map with route-contextual weather and some form of intelligent POI display.
